# Welcome to my React Dashboard Tutorial

This repository provides a practical exercise and solution on how to implement a simple React 
dashboard using CoreUI and connecting to databricks via node.js connector.

You can find detailed instructions in the readmes in the backend and 
coreui-free-react-admin-template folder.

If you are only interested in the dashboard part, check out the branch ```dashboard-exercise```.

You can find an example implementation on branch ```main```.

### Have fun! :)
